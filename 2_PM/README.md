# Day 1 PM: Personal Website

Let's build a basic website with HTML and CSS!

## Specification

Your website must include the following elements:

- at least 4 separate pages X
- one table X
- three images X
- a navigation bar where you can access every page X
- two clickable images
- four links to external pages X
- one bulleted list X
- two numbered lists X

Check out W3 Schools [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) or [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) tutorials if you're unsure of how do something. For now, we'll just separate our pages into different HTML files. One of them, index.html, is already created for you and should act as the "Home" page. You can just use one CSS file. To link to another page, just use an anchor tag with an href value of FILENAME.html.

### Running the App
 First, make sure you have the Live Server extension installed. You can then click the "Go Live" button on the right side of the bottom bar of VSCode. If you do not see it there, press cmd+shift+P and search "Live Server" -> click on "Live Server: Open with Live Server".
